## I do stuff with Game Development, Python and Web Dev.
I do alot of stuff, I'm an aspiring developer that's working on multiple open source projects on Github. One of them being BetterTimetable, the project that keeps getting delayed because I suck at Python (god help me). I've got quite a bit experience in Web Development and I'm currently working on learning Game Development with UE4 :D
## Projects:
### BetterTimetable: :book:
"**A simple Python program that helps you track your timetable. Initially this was just a small idea I had, but I've decided to scale it up a bit adding new features over the course of time. At it's current state it's extremely basic, and doesn't even track things, yet.**"
### BoilingPoint: :fire:
"**Boiling Point is a fast paced game that takes the smooth skill-based mechanics of an MMO and lets you experiment and customise it with it's own story and levels.**" (This is a work in progress that I haven't revealed and probably won't anytime soon. But I will, eventually.
## What else do you do?
I play Valorant, F1 and League. I am known to suck at all of those games. On top of that I like to just spend alot of my time learning how to make things. I also do because @Universal-Blaster-Studios told me that I can.
## Some other stuff.
**G2 Esports and Rekkles fanboy, I use VSCode, Visual Studio and PyCharm as Code Editors and I spend more time messing around in my repositorys than I do actually contributing to them :*)**
