## I do stuff with Python and Web Development
Welcome to my profile! I try to make solutions for problems I encounter using Python. You might have seen 'BetterTimetable' [https://github.com/rootinstinct/BetterTimetable], which is a personal project I'm working on to help make tracking my own timetable *better*.
## What else do you do?
I play Valorant, League and I develop things.
## Some other stuff.
**I am the biggest G2 Esports fanboy, I use Visual Studio Code and PyCharm and I have too much time on my hands.**
