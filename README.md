## I do stuff with Game Development, Python and Web Dev.
Welcome to my profile! I'm currently learning Game Development (C#) as well as Python. I have an ongoing Open-Source public project called BetterTimetable. It's going to be the first of many ideas that I have but check it out (and if you know python please help me out dude i'm struggling). If you throw in a star and follow me I'll throw in a :cookie:
## What else do you do?
I play Valorant, F1 and League. I am known to suck at all of those games. On top of that I like to just spend alot of my time learning how to make things. I also do because @Universal-Blaster-Studios told me that I can.
## Some other stuff.
**G2 Esports and Rekkles fanboy, I use VSCode, Visual Studio and PyCharm as Code Editors and I spend more time messing around in my repositorys than I do actually contributing to them :*)**
